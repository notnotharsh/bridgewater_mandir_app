# Sri Venkateswara Temple App
------

This app exists so that volunteers at the gift shop of the Sri Venkateswara Temple (Balaji Mandir) can successfully and efficiently update the inventories of the many items sold.

Instructions to Compile
------

To compile for either Android or iOS, install Flutter from [these instructions](https://flutter.io/setup).

### Compiling for Android

Run `flutter build apk` in the repository root to generate the release APK.

### Compiling to iOS

Complete the necessary setup in Xcode (after plugging the intended device into a Mac) in order to run `flutter build ios` in the repository root.

Distribution
------

  * The APK file at `build/app/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk` can be shared anywhere, through Drive or e-mail.
  * For iOS, compress the generated app into an IPA file. Using a service such as [Diawi](https://diawi.com), it may be possible to distribute said scouting app without necessarily connecting every device to a Mac. This depends on a number of factors, such as the size of the app, how many times it is to be downloaded, etc. If there is a better way to install iOS apps, please let me know!
